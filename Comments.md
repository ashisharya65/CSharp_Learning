# Comments
Comments can be used to explain C# code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.

# Single-line Comments

Single-line comments start with two forward slashes **(//)**.

Any text between **//** and the end of the line is ignored by C# (will not be executed).

This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code:

# C# Multi-line Comments

Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.

Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by C#.

This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code:
