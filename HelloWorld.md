* Line 1 using System means that we can use classes from the System namespace.

* Line 2 A blank line. C# ignores white space. However, multiple lines makes the code more readable.

* Line 3 namespace is used to organize your code, and it is a container for classes and other namespaces.

* Line 4 The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.

* Line 5 class is a container for data and methods, which brings functionality to your program. Every line of code that runs in C# must be inside a class. In our example, we     named the class Program.
